VisualDL uses the same manylinux environment docker image with PaddlePaddle, the related wiki is <https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/tree/develop/tools/manylinux1>.

We can use this [build file](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/blob/develop/tools/manylinux1/build_scripts/build.sh) to build this manylinux environment. But most of the time, we can directly use `paddlepaddle/paddle_manylinux_devel:cuda8.0_cudnn5`.

You can use this [check script](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/blob/develop/tools/manylinux1/build_scripts/manylinux1-check.py) to check the build envrionment.

The whole build step can be:

1. Get the manyliux build docker image `paddlepaddle/paddle_manylinux_devel:cuda8.0_cudnn5` and enter.

    ```shell
    docker run -it paddlepaddle/paddle_manylinux_devel:cuda8.0_cudnn5 /bin/bash
    ```

1. Paddle doesn't support python 3 yet. Therefore, we must setup the python3 environment first.
    ```
    yum install https://centos6.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm

    yum -y install python36u
    yum -y install python36u-pip
    yum -y install python36u-devel

    yum -y install python35u
    yum -y install python35u-pip
    yum -y install python35u-devel

    yum -y install python34u
    yum -y install python34u-pip
    yum -y install python34u-devel
    ```

1. Next, we need to setup Node.js so we can build the frontend code.
    ```
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash
    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
    nvm install node
    ```

1. Get the VisualDL code and run docs/release/build.sh. It will generate a whl file like `visualdl-0.0.2a0-cp27-cp27m(u)-linux_x86_64.whl`

    - If you run into some SSL issues like following while downloading some packages, this is due to CMake not configured with SSL in old linux OS. Skip
    to next step if you do not encounter this.

        ```shell
             status_code: 1
             status_string: "Unsupported protocol"
             Protocol "https" not supported or disabled in libcurl
        ```

        Solution is we need to rebuild CMake from source and configure it to point to system `curl` that comes with SSL.

        ```shell
             yum -y install zlib-devel libcurl-devel
             wget https://cmake.org/files/v3.12/cmake-3.12.0.tar.gz
             tar xzvf cmake-3.12.0.tar.gz
             cd cmake-3.12.0
             ./configure --system-curl
             make
             make install
        ```

        Remove `build` folder and rerun the build command.

1. The `linux` above should be renamed to `manylinux1`

    ```shell
    mv visualdl-0.0.2a0-cp27-cp27m-linux_x86_64.whl visualdl-0.0.2a0-cp27-cp27m-
    manylinux1_x86_64.whl
    ```
1. Before upload to the final pypi website, you can first upload it to a test repo `https://testpypi.python.org/pypi` and test the installation process.
    ```shell
    pip install twine
    twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ visualdl-*xx.whl
    pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ your-package
    ```

1. Use twine to upload the package to pypi.
    ```shell
    pip install twine
    twine upload xx.whl
    ```

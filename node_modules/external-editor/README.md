`npm install external-editor --save`

A simple example using the `.edit` convenience method

    var ExternalEditor = require('external-editor')
    var data = ExternalEditor.edit('\n\n# Please write your text above');
    console.log(data);

A full featured example

    var ExternalEditor = require('external-editor');
    
    try {
        var editor = new ExternalEditor();
        var text = editor.run()
        // the text is also available in editor.text
    } catch (err) {
        if (err instanceOf ExternalEditor.CreateFileError) {
            console.log('Failed to create the temporary file');
        } else if (err instanceOf ExternalEditor.ReadFileError) {
            console.log('Failed to read the temporary file');
        } else if (err instanceOf ExternalEditor.LaunchEditorError) {
            console.log('Failed to launch your editor');
        } else {
            throw err;
        }
    }
    
    // Do things with the text
    
    // Eventually call the cleanup to remove the temporary file
    try {
        editor.cleanup();   
    } catch (err) {
         if (err instanceOf ExternalEditor.RemoveFileError) {
             console.log('Failed to remove the temporary file');
         } else {
            throw err
        }
    }
    
    
#### API
**Static Methods**

- `edit(text)`
    - `text` (string) *Optional* Defaults to empty string
    - **Returns** (string) The contents of the file
    - Could throw `CreateFileError`, `ReadFileError`, or `LaunchEditorError`, or `RemoveFileError`
- `editAsync(text, callback)`
    - `text` (string) *Optional* Defaults to empty string
    - `callback` (function (error, text))
        - `error` could be of type `CreateFileError`, `ReadFileError`, or `LaunchEditorError`, or `RemoveFileError`
        - `text`(string) The contents of the file     


**Static Properties**

- `CreateFileError` Error thrown if the temporary file could not be created. 
- `ReadFileError` Error thrown if the temporary file could not be read.
- `RemoveFileError` Error thrown if the temporary file could not be removed during cleanup.
- `LaunchEditorError` Error thrown if the editor could not be launched.

**Public Methods**

- `new ExternalEditor(text)`
    - `text` (string) *Optional* Defaults to empty string
    - Could throw `CreateFileError`
- `run()` Launches the editor.
    - **Returns** (string) The contents of the file
    - Could throw `LaunchEditorError` or `ReadFileError`
- `runAsync(callback)` Launches the editor in an async way
    - `callback` (function (error, text))
        - `error` could be of type `ReadFileError` or `LaunchEditorError`
        - `text`(string) The contents of the file
- `cleanup()`  Removes the temporary file.
    - Could throw `RemoveFileError`
    
**Public Properties**

- `text` (string) *readonly* The text in the temporary file.
- `editor.bin` (string) The editor determined from the environment.
- `editor.args` (array) Default arguments for the bin
- `temp_file` (string) Path to temporary file. Can be changed, but be careful as the temporary file probably already 
    exists and would need be removed manually.
    
## Errors

All errors have a simple message explaining what went wrong. They all also have an `original_error` property containing
the original error thrown for debugging purposes.
    
## Why Synchronous?
 
Everything is synchronous to make sure the editor has complete control of the stdin and stdout. Testing has shown 
async launching of the editor can lead to issues when using readline or other packages which try to read from stdin or 
write to stdout. Seeing as this will be used in an interactive CLI environment, I made the decision to force the package
to be synchronous. If you know a reliable way to force all stdin and stdout to be limited only to the child_process,
please submit a PR.

If async is really needed, you can use `editAsync` or `runAsync`. If you are using readline or have anything else
listening to the stdin or you write to stdout, you will most likely have problem, so make sure to remove any other 
listeners on stdin, stdout, or stdin.
